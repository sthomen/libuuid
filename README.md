libuuid
=======

This is a minimal drop in replacement of the linux-utils libuuid for platforms
that are neither GNU nor Linux.

The GUID:s generated by this library don't attempt to be cryptographically
secure in any way, it just makes the stupid libraries that depend on in that
in no way need to have good entropy work.

Currently implemented:

- uuid\_t
- uuid\_generate\_random
- uuid\_generate (macro of uuid\_generate\_random)
- uuid\_unparse
- uuid\_copy
- uuid\_parse
