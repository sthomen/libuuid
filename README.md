libuuid
=======

This is a minimal drop in replacement of the linux-utils libuuid for platforms
that are neither GNU nor Linux.

The GUID:s generated by this library don't attempt to be cryptographically
secure in any way, it just makes the stupid libraries that depend on in that
in no way need to have good entropy work.

Currently implemented:

- uuid\_t
- uuid\_generate\_random
- uuid\_generate (macro of uuid\_generate\_random)
- uuid\_unparse
- uuid\_copy
- uuid\_parse

Building
--------

Normally it should be the usual

```
$ make
# make install
```

..but on some platforms you may need to explicitly add CFLAGS=-fPIC

The Makefile allows you to override RM, LD, CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, INSTALL, LIB\_SUFFIX and of course PREFIX
to change build/install parameters.

Testing
-------

libuuid now uses cmocka for testing, use `make test` to compile and run the unit tests.

Available make flags are CMOCKA\_LDFLAGS and CMOCKA\_CFLAGS to locate the include and lib files. In the future
this may be replaced by pkg-config.
